# bspline-jax
Simple implementation of B-Splines, M-Splines and I-Splines in jax, supporting jitting and  precomputation of the basis for even faster evaluation

## Usage
  For example usage look in the 
  
   ```
    if __name__ == "__main__":
    ...
  ```

section of each file. If you execute the file, it will first precompute and cache the basis splines and then generate plots of random splines.
